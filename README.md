       - Right click the icon and select sign in (this may look different than the origional prompt).  
     - You can login with your dockerid or the email you created your account with. Use your dockerid (otherwise it will cause issues later).   
       - If you do not know your dockerid you can find it by logging onto [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/) and looking in the top right you should see a dropdown menu with your Docker id on it.  

   5. Shared Drives

    - Type Powershell, click on Windows Powershell.
    - Enter this command into the prompt:  
    `docker build -t cylc C:\cylc\webscrape\`  

### Run

 - Right click webscrape_wrapper.ps1 (from the beginning) and select "run with PowerShell" (if this is not an option select open).  
 - The powershell window that opens can be closed.  
 - Open any web browser and go to localhost:5800 to confirm it is working.  
 
### Automatic scheduling

 - Click Windows icon.
 - type 'task scheduler'.
 - select task scheduler
 - select "Action".
 - select "import task".
 - go to C:\cylc\webscrape\
 - select Start Cylc.xml
 - select OK.

### Debugging

Make sure the folders are currect from step one.

On the windows toolbar, hidden icons, right click docker and select Restart.  
Even if this does not solve the issue it is important to do this while debugging.  
It is common for a container to "reserve" or otherwise restrict your container from using certain important resources.  
Other issues can continuously cause this issue, so restart often while debugging.  

Resetting docker to factory defaults may help as well.

Especially if you shared drives with a new accout, make sure that account has permisions to all the folders and files mentioned.  
 - Right click on C:\RT_Contents\.  
 - Click "Give access to".  
 - Select the username you created.  
 - Select "Yes, share the items."  
 - Repeat for C:\cylc\webscrape\
