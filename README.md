    - This will prompt you to login.

    - This requires you to use an account with a password. (for some reason)  
    **If your account has a password then enter your password in the password box, select OK.**  
    **If your account does not have a password you need to create a new account with a password.**

 - The powershell window that opens can be closed.  
 - Open any web browser and go to localhost:5800 to confirm it is working.  

### Debugging

On the windows toolbar, hidden icons, right click docker and select Restart.  
Even if this does not solve the issue it is important to do this while debugging.  
It is common for a container to "reserve" or otherwise restrict your container from using certain important resources.  
Other issues can continuously cause this issue, so restart often while debugging.  

Especially if you shared drives with a new accout, make sure that account has permisions to all the folders and files mentioned.  
 - Right click on C:\RT_Contents\.  
 - Click "Give access to".  
 - Select the username you created.  
 - Select "Yes, share the items."  
 - Repeat for C:\cylc\webscrape\
