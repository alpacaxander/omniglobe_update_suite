## Debugging

Make sure the folders are currect from step one.

On the windows toolbar, hidden icons, right click docker and select Restart.  
Even if this does not solve the issue it is important to do this while debugging.  
It is common for a container to "reserve" or otherwise restrict your container from using certain important resources.  
Other issues can continuously cause this issue, so restart often while debugging.  

Resetting docker to factory defaults may help as well.

Especially if you shared drives with a new accout, make sure that account has permisions to all the folders and files mentioned.  
 - Right click on C:\RT_Contents\.  
 - Click "Give access to".  
 - Select the username you created.  
 - Select "Yes, share the items."  
 - Repeat for C:\cylc\webscrape\
